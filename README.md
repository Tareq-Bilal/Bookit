# 📚 Bookit – Modern Library Management System

**Bookit** is a powerful and modern library management system designed to simplify book tracking, user management, and lending workflows. Built with **C# and .NET**, it offers an elegant and efficient platform for libraries of any size to digitize their operations and improve member engagement.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Built with C# and .NET**  
  Developed using the latest .NET technologies to ensure performance, maintainability, and scalability.

- 📚 **Manages books, members, loans, and fines**  
  Handles the entire library lifecycle including book inventory, user accounts, loan processing, return tracking, and fine calculation.

- 🧩 **Uses Repository Pattern with Unit of Work**  
  Implements a clean data access layer with separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to test and maintain.

- 🔄 **Integrated AutoMapper for mapping**  
  Automates object-to-object mapping between domain models, DTOs, and view models to reduce boilerplate code.

- ✅ **FluentValidation for clean input validation**  
  Ensures robust and readable model validation with fluent rules to keep logic out of controllers.

- 📊 **Serilog for structured logging**  
  Provides detailed and structured logging across the application for better monitoring, debugging, and diagnostics.

- ⚡ **Caching for performance optimization**  
  Implements in-memory or distributed caching strategies to reduce response time and database load.

- 🔐 **Token-based Authentication & Authorization**  
  Secures APIs using JWT tokens and role-based access control to protect user data and enforce permissions.

- 📈 **Scalable and clean architecture for real-world libraries**  
  Designed with extensibility and modularity in mind, making it adaptable to small community libraries or large academic systems.
